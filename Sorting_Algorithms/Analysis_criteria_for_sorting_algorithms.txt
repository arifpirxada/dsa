-> Analysis criteria for sorting algorithms - Criterias to analyze "Sorting Algorithms"

Some commonly used criterias to analyze "Sorting Algorithms":

1. Time Complexity.

2. Space Complexity.

3. Stability: If there are two equal numbers in a Data Structure, 
the first of the two equal numbers should come first after the sorting is done.
If an algo follows this then the algo is stable.

4. Internal Sorting Algorithm: All data is loaded into the memory.
    External Sorting Algorithm: All data is not loaded into the memory, it reads data.

5. Adaptive: Already sorted data takes less time.

6. Recursive: Algorithm which uses recursion.
