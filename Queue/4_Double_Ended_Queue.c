// Double Ended Queue - DEQueue: it is a type of queue which does not follow FIFO (first in first out).
// We can perforn insertion and deletion from both ends that is:
// Insertion from front + rear & Deletion from front + rear;

// Two types of DEQueue:
// 1. Restriction Input DEQueue - Insertion from front not allowed
// 1. Restriction Output DEQueue - Deletion from rear not allowed

// Implementation comming soon!
